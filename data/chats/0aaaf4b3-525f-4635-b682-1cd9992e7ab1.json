It sets clear expectations, standards, and procedures, eliminating ambiguity and adhocism. It also enables clarity and norming of practices, guides standardization, and promotes faith in HR practices. Additionally, it helps in attracting and retaining committed employees, provides fair compensation, and rewards performance, ultimately leading to a healthy work environment.",
